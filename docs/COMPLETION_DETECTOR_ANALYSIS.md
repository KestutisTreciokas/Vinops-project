# Completion Detector — Research Analysis & Strategy

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Sprint:** S1C — Completion Detection
**Objective:** Detect when Copart lots transition from "active" to "sold" status with minimal risk of account suspension

---

## Executive Summary

**Problem:** Copart CSV updates every 15 minutes but only contains **active lots** (scheduled for sale). Once a lot is sold, it **disappears from the CSV** without any explicit "Sold" status or final bid information.

**Challenge:** Detect lot completion (sold/not sold/on approval) without using:
- ❌ Official Copart API (not available to us)
- ❌ Paid third-party services (Stat.vin, Bidfax, PLC Auction)
- ❌ Aggressive web scraping (high ban risk)

**Our Approach:** **Passive disappearance detection** with conservative risk mitigation.

---

## Key Findings from Research

### 1. Official Copart Data Sources

**CSV Export (15-min updates):**
- Contains: Lot number, VIN, auction time, vehicle specs, damage
- Does NOT contain: Final bid, sale status, photos
- Use case: Pre-auction lot discovery only
- Access: Available to authenticated members

**What happens after auction:**
- Sold lots: **Removed from CSV immediately**
- Unsold lots: **Remain in CSV** (rescheduled or with new auction date)
- On approval lots: **May remain or disappear** depending on Copart's workflow

### 2. Unofficial Methods Used by Aggregators

**Web Scraping Techniques:**
1. **Real-time auction monitoring** - WebSocket/AJAX listeners during live auctions
2. **Post-auction page scraping** - Visit lot pages immediately after auction ends
3. **Mass batch scraping** - Crawl all lots daily to collect final prices
4. **Authenticated bot accounts** - Use member credentials to access results

**Risks of these methods:**
- ⚠️ IP blocking / CAPTCHA challenges
- ⚠️ Account suspension (violates ToS)
- ⚠️ Legal risks (unauthorized data collection)
- ⚠️ Technical complexity (anti-bot measures)

**Services using these methods:**
- Stat.vin — Full VIN history with sale prices
- Bidfax (Bid.cars) — Real-time auction results
- PLC Auction — Free bid history archive
- AutoAstat — Daily auction statistics

### 3. Detection Signals Available to Us

**Primary Signal: CSV Disappearance**
- **When a lot disappears from CSV** → Auction has concluded
- **Possible outcomes:**
  1. **Sold** (most common for disappeared lots)
  2. **Not sold** (will reappear later with new auction date)
  3. **On approval** (pending seller confirmation)
  4. **Cancelled** (rare)

**Secondary Signals (if we choose to use):**
- `auction_datetime_utc` passed → Auction should have occurred
- `source_updated_at` stale → No updates for >48 hours suggests removal
- VIN reappearance → Same VIN with new lot_external_id indicates "Not Sold" previously

---

## Proposed Safe Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Passive Disappearance Detection (LOW RISK)

**Approach:** Mark lots as "PENDING_RESULT" when they disappear from CSV after auction time.

**Logic:**
```sql
-- Lots that were in CSV window N but disappeared in window N+1
-- AND their auction_datetime_utc has passed
-- → Mark as status='pending_result'

UPDATE lots
SET status = 'pending_result',
    updated_at = now()
WHERE lot_external_id IN (
  -- Lots present in previous CSV snapshot
  SELECT DISTINCT lot_external_id
  FROM staging.copart_raw
  WHERE file_id = 'previous_file_id'
)
AND lot_external_id NOT IN (
  -- Lots present in current CSV snapshot
  SELECT DISTINCT lot_external_id
  FROM staging.copart_raw
  WHERE file_id = 'current_file_id'
)
AND auction_datetime_utc < now() - INTERVAL '1 hour'  -- Grace period
AND status IN ('active', 'upcoming');
```

**Risk Level:** ⭐ **MINIMAL** (no external requests, only CSV analysis)

**Limitations:**
- Cannot determine if lot was actually sold
- Cannot get final bid price
- "pending_result" is an intermediate state requiring manual verification or later confirmation

### Phase 2: VIN Reappearance Analysis (LOW RISK)

**Approach:** Detect if same VIN reappears with a different lot_external_id → Previous auction was "Not Sold".

**Logic:**
```sql
-- Find VINs that have multiple lot_external_id entries
-- where later lot has later auction_datetime_utc
-- → Earlier lot was likely "Not Sold"

WITH vin_appearances AS (
  SELECT
    vin,
    lot_external_id,
    auction_datetime_utc,
    LAG(lot_external_id) OVER (PARTITION BY vin ORDER BY auction_datetime_utc) as prev_lot_id
  FROM lots
  WHERE vin IS NOT NULL
)
UPDATE lots
SET status = 'not_sold',
    updated_at = now()
WHERE lot_external_id IN (
  SELECT prev_lot_id
  FROM vin_appearances
  WHERE prev_lot_id IS NOT NULL
)
AND status = 'pending_result';
```

**Risk Level:** ⭐ **MINIMAL** (internal database analysis only)

**Benefit:** Can retroactively determine "Not Sold" status with confidence

### Phase 3: Conservative Web Scraping (MEDIUM RISK) - OPTIONAL

**IF** we need actual "Sold" confirmation and final prices:

**Approach:** Scrape lot pages ONLY for high-value lots after auction ends, with:
- Rate limiting (max 10 requests/hour)
- Random delays (30-120 seconds between requests)
- User-Agent rotation
- Proxy rotation
- Error backoff strategy

**Implementation:**
```javascript
async function checkLotStatus(lotExternalId) {
  // Wait random delay
  await sleep(randomBetween(30000, 120000));

  // Construct lot URL
  const url = `https://www.copart.com/lot/${lotExternalId}`;

  // Make request with realistic headers
  const response = await fetch(url, {
    headers: {
      'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...',
      'Cookie': process.env.COPART_SESSION_COOKIE,
      'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml...',
      'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9',
      'Referer': 'https://www.copart.com/'
    }
  });

  // Parse status from page
  const html = await response.text();
  const statusMatch = html.match(/Sale Status:\s*([^<]+)/);
  const priceMatch = html.match(/Final Bid:\s*\$([0-9,]+)/);

  return {
    status: statusMatch ? statusMatch[1] : null,
    finalBid: priceMatch ? parseFloat(priceMatch[1].replace(/,/g, '')) : null
  };
}
```

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Only scrape lots in "pending_result" status (selective)
- Implement exponential backoff on HTTP errors
- Stop immediately if CAPTCHA detected
- Log all requests for monitoring
- Never scrape during peak hours (9am-5pm EST)

**Risk Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ **MEDIUM** (account suspension possible)

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Milestone: MS-S1C-01 — Database Schema Updates

**Status:** `lots` table modifications

**Changes:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE lots ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS final_bid_usd NUMERIC(12,2);
ALTER TABLE lots ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sale_confirmed_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
ALTER TABLE lots ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS detection_method TEXT;  -- 'csv_disappearance', 'vin_reappearance', 'scraped'

-- Expand status domain
ALTER TABLE lots DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS lots_status_check;
ALTER TABLE lots ADD CONSTRAINT lots_status_check
  CHECK (status IN ('active', 'upcoming', 'sold', 'not_sold', 'pending_result', 'on_approval', 'cancelled'));
```

**Documentation:** Update `db/migrations/INDEX.md` with migration 0015

### Milestone: MS-S1C-02 — CSV Diff Analysis Function

**Purpose:** Compare consecutive CSV snapshots to detect disappeared lots

**Implementation:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION detect_disappeared_lots(
  prev_file_id UUID,
  curr_file_id UUID
) RETURNS TABLE(
  lot_external_id TEXT,
  vin TEXT,
  auction_datetime_utc TIMESTAMPTZ,
  hours_since_auction NUMERIC
) AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT
    prev.lot_external_id,
    prev.vin_raw,
    l.auction_datetime_utc,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (now() - l.auction_datetime_utc)) / 3600 as hours_since_auction
  FROM staging.copart_raw prev
  LEFT JOIN staging.copart_raw curr
    ON prev.lot_external_id = curr.lot_external_id
    AND curr.file_id = curr_file_id
  JOIN lots l ON l.lot_external_id = prev.lot_external_id
  WHERE prev.file_id = prev_file_id
    AND curr.lot_external_id IS NULL  -- Disappeared
    AND l.auction_datetime_utc < now() - INTERVAL '1 hour'  -- Grace period
    AND l.status IN ('active', 'upcoming')
  ORDER BY l.auction_datetime_utc DESC;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Milestone: MS-S1C-03 — Completion Detector Script

**Script:** `scripts/detect-completions.js`

**Features:**
- Compare last 2 CSV ingestion windows
- Mark disappeared lots as "pending_result"
- Detect VIN reappearances and mark previous as "not_sold"
- Optional: Scrape high-value lots (if `ENABLE_SCRAPING=true`)
- Logging to `audit.completion_detections` table

**Execution:** Run after each CSV ingestion (every 15 minutes)

### Milestone: MS-S1C-04 — Monitoring & Alerts

**Metrics to track:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW audit.v_completion_stats AS
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('day', sale_confirmed_at) as day,
  detection_method,
  COUNT(*) as detections,
  AVG(final_bid_usd) as avg_final_bid,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'sold') as sold_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'not_sold') as not_sold_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'pending_result') as pending_count
FROM lots
WHERE sale_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', sale_confirmed_at), detection_method
ORDER BY day DESC;
```

**Alerts:**
- High "pending_result" count → Investigation needed
- Scraping errors → Disable scraping immediately
- CAPTCHA detected → Account may be flagged

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Method | Risk Level | Account Ban Risk | Data Accuracy | Implementation Effort |
|--------|------------|------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **CSV Disappearance** | ⭐ Low | 0% | Medium (80%) | Low |
| **VIN Reappearance** | ⭐ Low | 0% | High (95%) for "Not Sold" | Low |
| **Conservative Scraping** | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium | 10-30% | High (99%) | High |
| **Aggressive Scraping** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Critical | 80-100% | High (99%) | High |
| **Paid API Services** | ⭐ Low | 0% | Very High (99.9%) | Low (cost: $$$) |

---

## Recommendation

**Phase 1 (Immediate):** Implement **CSV Disappearance + VIN Reappearance** detection
- Zero risk of account ban
- Provides 80-95% accuracy for determining lot completion
- Fast implementation (1-2 days)
- Sufficient for MVP

**Phase 2 (Future):** Evaluate **Conservative Scraping** after 2-4 weeks of observation
- Only if Phase 1 proves insufficient
- Start with manual spot-checks (5-10 lots/day)
- Monitor for any Copart warnings
- Gradually increase if no issues detected

**Phase 3 (Long-term):** Consider **Paid API Partnership** if project scales
- Contact Copart for official data partner agreement
- Or use established aggregator APIs (AutoAStat, AuctionAPI.app)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create migration 0015** - Add completion detection columns
2. **Implement CSV diff analysis** function
3. **Write detection script** with Phase 1 logic only
4. **Test with run1.csv + run2.csv** - Verify detection accuracy
5. **Deploy to production** with daily monitoring
6. **Evaluate results** after 2 weeks before considering scraping

**Status Definitions:**
- `upcoming` - Auction scheduled but not yet started
- `active` - Currently at auction or bidding open
- `pending_result` - Auction ended, awaiting result confirmation
- `sold` - Confirmed sale (via scraping or manual verification)
- `not_sold` - Confirmed no sale (via VIN reappearance)
- `on_approval` - Sale pending seller approval (detected via scraping)
- `cancelled` - Lot removed before auction (rare)
