# Copart Final Bid Implementation ‚Äî 5-Sprint Plan

**Status:** üìã **PLANNING**
**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Objective:** Deliver complete Copart final bid & outcome detection system

- ‚úÖ **Lot outcomes** (Sold/Not Sold/On Approval)
- ‚úÖ **VIN history** (linking multiple sale attempts)
- ‚úÖ **Legal compliance** (respect ToS, minimize blocking risk)

| Copart blocks CSV access | Use reasonable polling (15 min), official endpoint, monitor for changes | Eng | ‚úÖ |
| Third-party API discontinues service | Build PoC 2 as backup, maintain CSV-only fallback | Eng | üîÑ |

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
|------|------------|-------|--------|
| Event store grows too large | Partition by month, archive after 1 year, add retention policy | Eng | ‚è≠Ô∏è |

| API rate limits exceeded | Implement backoff, queue system, batch requests | Eng | ‚è≠Ô∏è |
| False positives (sold ‚Üí not_sold) | Lower confidence threshold, manual review queue | Product | ‚è≠Ô∏è |

### Operational Risks

| Risk | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
|------|------------|-------|--------|
| Systemd timer fails silently | Add health check, alert on missed runs (>2h gap) | DevOps | ‚è≠Ô∏è |
| Database migration downtime | Apply during maintenance window, test rollback | DevOps | ‚è≠Ô∏è |
| Cost overruns (API/proxies) | Set budget alerts, monthly review, fallback to CSV-only | Finance | ‚è≠Ô∏è |

## Contingency Plans

### If CSV access blocked
1. Immediately pause csv-diff timer
2. Rely on third-party API (if deployed)
3. Contact Copart support to restore access
4. Consider member account upgrade if needed

### If third-party API fails
1. Fall back to CSV-only method
2. Evaluate alternative API providers
3. Consider JSON scraper (with legal review)

### If heuristics too inaccurate
1. Lower confidence thresholds
2. Add manual review queue for low-confidence outcomes
3. Accelerate S3 (ML refinement)
4. Collect more labeled training data
